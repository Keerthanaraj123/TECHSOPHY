##TECHSOPHY CODING TEST

**A smart calculator that gives fair, AI-based insurance prices based on who the person is and what's happening in the market.**

**Goal:** Calculate insurance premium based on:
1. User inputs (age, health status, driving history, location)

2. Risk model (using ML)

3. Market trends (simplified random simulation)

4. Final pricing with explanation

## Step 1: Importing Libraries

We import:
- `random` to simulate market conditions,
- `numpy` to handle numerical data,
- `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn to build our AI model.


## Step 2: Building the AI Model

We define a class `SmartPremiumEstimator`. Inside it:
- We train a simple **Linear Regression** model using example data.
- The inputs are `age` and `number of accidents(claims)`.
- The output is a `risk score` from 0.0 (safe) to 1.0 (risky).



##  Step 3: Risk Score and Market Simulation

- `_predict_risk_factor`: Uses the trained model to predict risk.
- `_market_variation`: Simulates real-world market changes using a random number between 0.9 and 1.1.



##  Step 4: Calculating the Final Premium

We use the formula:

Final Premium = Base Price × (1 + Risk Score) × Market Factor



- Then we round the result and return both the premium and an explanation for the user.


##  Step 5: Taking Input and Displaying the Result

- We collect the user's age and accident history.
- If the input is valid, we calculate the premium using our model.
- We then display a clear explanation of the premium calculation.
